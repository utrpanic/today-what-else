> Now that we've explored the Combine framework and identified its correspondence with the `Effect` type, let's refactor our architecture to take full advantage of it.

### Other reactive libraries

In this episode we mentioned that one could replace the Combine framework with any reactive framework, including ReactiveSwift and RxSwift. Two of our viewers did just that. Thanks to [HÃ¥kon Bogen](https://github.com/haaakon) and [Alexander Sokol](https://github.com/ixrevo) for refactoring the PrimeTime application to have its effects run off of ReactiveSwift and RxSwift, respectively.
