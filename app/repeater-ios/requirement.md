## Overview:
This app allows users to quickly save and reuse Slack messages, preserving mentions and links.

## Requirements:
- When the Add button is pressed, an input field should appear where users can paste content copied from Slack.
- Each saved message should be represented as a button inside a Grid layout.
- Pressing a message button should copy the corresponding message back to the clipboard.
- Mentions, links, and other rich formatting from the original Slack message must be preserved exactly when saving and copying.
